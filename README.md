# Introduction

To solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Nearest Insertion algorithm and Euclidean distance calculation in Python, you can follow the steps below:

1. Read the data from the CSV file and store it in a list of dictionaries.
2. Calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of cities.
3. Initialize the route with the first city and add the remaining cities using the Nearest Insertion algorithm.
4. Calculate the total distance of the optimized route.

Here's the code to achieve this:
